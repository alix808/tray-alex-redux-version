I noticed that Redux was on your tech-stack, so I decided to re-write the test that you sent me using Redux (I used the Context API last time)

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Once all the relevant packages have been installed, in the route directory run:

### `npm run dev`

This will JSON-server and React in parallel.

The JSON-server acts as fake database.

Once you have submitted a valid password, and filled out all the necessary forms you should be able to find your sign-up details in the db.json (in the route directory)

In the route directory run

### `npm test`

This will initate the Jest tests, which are specifically designed to test the Redux API and the functional programming paradigm.
